# Voice Quiz App

## Overview
The Voice Quiz App is an interactive quiz generator that uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model to create multiple-choice questions based on a given topic or uploaded PDF document. It also features text-to-speech functionality to provide audio feedback and question narration, making it accessible and engaging.

## Features
- **Quiz Generation**: Generate multiple-choice questions based on a topic or PDF content.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Convert questions and feedback into audio using gTTS.
- **Voice Input for Answers**: Allows users to speak their answers, transcribed using OpenAI Whisper.
- **LLM-Powered Voice Answer Matching**: Intelligently matches transcribed spoken answers to the correct options.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Generate quizzes with Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score and progress throughout the quiz.
- **Dynamic Question Parsing**: Automatically parses and formats questions generated by the LLM.

## Planned Feature Enhancements
### 1. User Engagement & Gamification
- **Timed Quiz Mode**:
  - Implement a countdown timer using Python's `time` module or Streamlit's `st.empty()` and `time.sleep()`.
  - Automatically submit answers or mark them incorrect when time runs out.

- **Hints (Limited)**:
  - Add a "Hint" button to provide additional information or remove incorrect options (e.g., 50/50).
  - Requires additional LLM calls or pre-generated hints during question creation.

- **Badges/Achievements**:
  - Award badges based on scores, number of quizzes completed, or specific achievements (e.g., "Perfect Score on Science Quiz").
  - Add an "Achievements" section to display earned badges.

- **Leaderboard**:
  - Store user scores, quiz topics, and timestamps in a database (e.g., SQLite or Firebase).
  - Add a "View Leaderboard" button or tab to display top scores.
  - Allow users to enter a nickname after completing a quiz to record their score.

### 2. Quiz Content & Generation Enhancements
- **Question Type Variety**:
  - Support True/False and fill-in-the-blank questions in addition to multiple-choice questions.
  - Modify the LLM prompt and parsing logic to handle new formats.

- **Image/Media Integration**:
  - Integrate relevant images or media for questions or options (complex implementation).
  - Use `st.image()` to display images alongside questions.

- **Customize Options Count**:
  - Allow users to choose the number of options per question (e.g., 2, 3, 4, or 5).
  - Adjust the LLM prompt and parsing logic accordingly.

- **Review Quiz/Mistakes**:
  - Provide a summary of all questions, user answers, correct answers, and explanations after the quiz ends.
  - Highlight incorrect answers for learning purposes.

- **Topic Specificity Control**:
  - Allow users to specify sub-topics or exclusions (e.g., "History of World War II, but exclude battles").
  - Add detailed instructions to the LLM prompt.

### 3. Technical & User Experience Improvements
- **User Accounts**:
  - Integrate authentication for persistent data (e.g., quiz history, scores, preferences).

- **Pre-defined Topics/Categories**:
  - Offer a list of popular or pre-curated topics (e.g., "Science," "History," "Pop Culture") for quick selection.

- **Download Quiz**:
  - Provide a button to download generated questions as a PDF or text file.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensure optimal layout across different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

- **Error Handling Refinements**:
  - Provide granular feedback for specific API errors (e.g., rate limits, invalid API key).

- **Advanced PDF Processing**:
  - Handle PDFs with tables, images, or complex layouts using more sophisticated libraries (e.g., `pdfminer.six`).

### Prioritization
The following features are recommended for immediate implementation:
1. **Leaderboard**: Encourages user engagement and return visits.
2. **Review Quiz/Mistakes**: Crucial for learning and improving.
3. **Timed Quiz Mode**: Adds an extra layer of challenge.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (stored in `.env` file)
- SerpAPI key (optional, for internet search functionality)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/voice-quiz-app.git
   cd voice-quiz-app
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
